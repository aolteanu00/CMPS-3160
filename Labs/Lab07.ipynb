        "Binary categorical variables (categorical variables with two categories) can be converted into quantitative variables by coding one category as 1 and the other category as 0. (In fact, the `survived` column in the Titanic data set is an example of a variable where this has been done.) But what do we do about a categorical variable with more than 2 categories, like `embarked`, which has 3 categories?\n",
        "\n",
        "We can convert a categorical variable with $K$ categories into $K$ separate 0/1 variables, or **dummy variables**. Each of the $K$ variables is an indicator for one of the $K$ categories. That is, each dummy variable is 1 if the observation fell into that category and 0 otherwise.\n",
